													RESPONSIBLE GAMING
											</h4>
											<p className="text">
														If you play you can win or lose. Gambling can be fun, exciting but there is no economic or mathematical certainty because of course, it’s only a game. In the worst cases you buy a little excitement at the right price.
												</p>
												<p className="text">
														What is the right price? For sure it’s what you can afford to gamble while feeling completely at ease. You decide in advance how much to spend on betting and never exceed that limit. You keep the commitment you have made to yourself. 
												</p>
												<p className="text">
														Problem gambling can be recognised by modes of conduct such as a high level of spending, poor work results, relationship difficulties, theft, lying and depression. If gambling becomes a problem then it is no longer entertainment. If gambling worries you take a break.
												</p>
												<p className="text">
														Protecting minors is a fundamental part of our responsible betting policy. Minors less than 18 years of age are forbidden from opening a betting account with Bet9ja. We immediately check the identity of all customers to prevent the services offered on our website being used by minors.
